How We Work

As a 1099 contractor, you to manage your time, tools, and territory like a pro. This policy outlines the expectations that keep us aligned, connected, and

Core Expectations


Professionalism Comes Standard


You represent The Utility Network every time you engage a customer, partner, or prospect. Communicate clearly, follow through on commitments, and operate with respect, transparency, and accuracy.


Responsiveness Matters


Timely follow-up is the lifeblood of our business. Whether it’s a lead, a team update, or a customer request, respond within one business day—even if it’s just to say “I’m on it.”


Results Drive Everything


We focus on what gets results: outreach, meaningful conversations, signed contracts, and long-term customer value. Set monthly goals. Use tools that track your pipeline. If something isn’t working, raise your hand—we’ll help.

That said: prioritize outreach during standard business hours in your market, be available for scheduled calls and customer meetings, and maintain a quiet, professional environment for virtual meetings.

Code of Conduct

Treat every customer with respect and honesty. No misleading claims, price manipulation, or pressure tactics—ever. Maintain confidentiality of all customer and company data. Report issues or concerns through the appropriate internal channel.

Final Word

We’re building something different here—real partnerships, real transparency, real outcomes. That requires ownership, hustle, and heart. If you’re aligned with that, you’re in the right place.
