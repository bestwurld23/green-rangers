Support execution of an existing ~70 MW pipeline.

You Bring:

5–10 years’ experience in renewable energy development, origination, or project finance (community/DG solar preferred).

No playbook exists for the problems we are solving. Every day, we are required to find answers to questions we’ve never been asked before. To make meaningful progress, we are unapologetically driven by asking “why?” constantly seeking better solutions and are unfazed by tackling things that are only implausibly possible.
